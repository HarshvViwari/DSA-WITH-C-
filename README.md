In this repo we talk about the following things
--> ARRAY CREATION 
--> DYNAMIC INPUT IN ARRAY
--> TRAVERSING
--> SEARCHING OF ELEMENTS 
--> SWAPINGS 
--> SORTING TECHIQUES 
--> UNSORTED SEARCH 

    IMPORTANT DSA INTERVIEW QUESTIONS FREQUENTLY 
    ASKED IN THE TOP MULTY NATIONAL COMPONIES
    THE   -- DSA PRACTICEE -- SHEET IS PORVIDED

TIME COMPLEXITY
1. BIG O NOTATION -- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE WORST CASE SINEARIO IN THE CODE EXECUTION
   IS CALLED BIG O TIME COMEPLXITY

2. BIG OMEGA -- WHE THE CODE EXECUTION IS THE BEST CASE SINEARIO IS TERMED AS BIG OMEGA
   NOTATION IN TIME COMPLEX.

               COMMON TIME COMPLEXITY
            O(K) -- FOR ANY CONSTANT
            O(N) -- FOR ANY LINEAR EXECUTION OF
                    A BLOCK OF CODE "LOOPS"
            O(N^2/3) -- FOR NESTED LOOPS
            O(LOGn) -- IT IS THE BEST TIME COMPLEXITY
                       'WHEN WE DO WORK FOR N/2 TIMES'

   EX.
   FOR(INT I=2; I*I<=N; I++){
    IF(N%2 == 0)
     COUT << NON PRIME ;
     BREAK;
   }

           IMPORTANT CODE CONSTRAINS
       N > 10^8 -- LOG N
       N < 10^8 -- O(N)
       N < 10^6 -- N LOGn
       N < 10^4 -- N^2
       N < 500 -- N^3
                     ETC
